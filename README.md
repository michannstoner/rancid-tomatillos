### Description
Rancid Tomatillos is a movie review application. The purpose of this project is to allow users to view a list of all movies, search for a specific movie, and view more information about a movie. In viewing more information about a movie, a user is shown a rating, the year the movie was released, it's genre and overview, along with a trailer for the movie! The learning goals for this project included:
- Using React.js 
- Creating multi-page UX implementing React Router 
- Implementing Cypress.io for acceptance testing
- Make network requests using RESTful APIs

### Wins & Challenges

#### Wins
We utilized several new technologies for this application, and we felt very comfortable using React despite having learned it in such a short amount of time.  We also felt the most comfortable applying breakpoints to make our application responsive across different devices than we have in the past.

#### Challenges
Cypress proved very challenging for us.  It was our first time utilizing this tool, and we had to familiarize ourselves with the appropriate syntax and assertion statements, while also learning the testing environment nuances.  We also had to master stubbing network requests, and simulating errors from the server.  React Router was challenging to put into place as well, as we had never used it before.


### Future Plans for Application
- Adding a feature that allows a user to favorite a movie, and adding a button to the navigation bar to toggle the view to favorited movies.  
- Adding a feature that lets users filter all movies based on genre.
- Making the video on the movie details' view visible on mobile devices.
- Allowing users to add their rating of a movie.
